# credit-risk-classification
This Upenn activity contains code to analyze credit risk for loans. The goal is to see if it's possible to find if a model can predict whether a loan is healthy or risky. It uses Logistic regression, resampling, oversampling, and machine learning evaluation tools such as confusion matrix in order to see how models preform. 

# Resources
This contains lending_data.csv which has the information to be predicted.

# credit_risk_classification.ipynb
This notebook contains the code for the machine learning models.

# credit_report.md
This contains the bulk of the questions/analysis to be answered, including a summary of what the results show and how it can be applied.
